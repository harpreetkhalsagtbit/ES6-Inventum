#Note:
You can notice that the code in the files is written in a irregular way. It is because I have used a `VSCode` extension [quokka](https://quokkajs.com/docs/index.html) which allows us to see the output of our code instantly in the code editor window. So the code actually is a multiple small snippets to understand the concepts of ES6 features in a Practise and Learn way.

To run code file with quokka
Press `ctrl+shift+p` and type `start on current file` and press `Enter`

To stop code file with quokka
Press `ctrl+shift+p` and type `stop all` and press `Enter`
